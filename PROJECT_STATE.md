# Jessica Project State

## Canonical identity

- Product name: `Jessica`
- Intended repository: `ai-systems-tw/jessica`
- Initial business scope: fashion glasses and sunglasses
- Architecture status: high-level design and decomposition design frozen for implementation
- Current gate: `G1_SINGLE_FRAME_RUNTIME_ACTIVE`

## Completed in the initial implementation slice

- Repository structure and source-of-truth documents
- Unit and asset contracts
- Tracking filter primitives
- Confidence/failure state machine
- Quality metrics and deterministic sample report
- Camera-permission browser shell
- Automated tests and CI workflow

## Completed G1 implementation slices

### `JSC-0201` MediaPipe Face Landmarker adapter

- Pinned `@mediapipe/tasks-vision@1.0.1`.
- Added a replaceable `FaceTrackingBackend` implementation with externally configured WASM and model paths.
- Build output self-hosts the pinned MediaPipe WASM files; the reviewed task model must be provisioned separately.
- Added initialization timeout, no-face handling, strict timestamp ordering, 4x4 matrix validation, network observation hooks, disposal, and clean reinitialization.
- Added deterministic adapter tests using an injected MediaPipe factory; live model/device evidence remains part of G1.

### `JSC-0202` Pose/camera adapter and `JSC-0202B` scale resolver

- Added deterministic column-major MediaPipe transform conversion into Jessica/Three.js camera space.
- Added selfie mirroring, `cover`/`contain` viewport mapping, vertical-FOV unprojection, canonical cm-to-m conversion, and configurable nose-bridge anchoring.
- Added MediaPipe iris pixel observations, bilateral consistency checks, rolling median, outlier rejection, low-pixel confidence downgrade, and explicit manual scale override.
- Added a frozen canonical pose fixture plus center, edge, mirror, crop, camera agreement, and scale-confidence tests.

### `JSC-0203` Three.js renderer shell and `JSC-0204` depth occlusion

- Pinned `three@0.185.1` and self-hosted the browser module plus the GLTF loader dependency graph.
- Added transparent WebGL scene lifecycle, GLB loading, immutable attachment-matrix application, camera near/far checks, lighting, DPR cap, resize observation, and deterministic disposal.
- Added pose/opacity application, physical scale correction with safety bounds, and fail-closed visibility.
- Added a dynamic depth-only facial mesh using validated MediaPipe tessellation triangles and per-frame viewport/depth mapping.

### G1 web vertical-slice integration

- Wired camera → MediaPipe → pose → iris scale → confidence gate → One Euro filters → depth mesh → GLB renderer in `try-on-web`.
- Added deterministic build-time calibration-proxy GLB generation; it is explicitly not J1-M and is not recommended for live product use.
- Added SHA-256-pinned provisioning for the official Face Landmarker model and official portrait fixture.
- Added a camera-free browser self-test. Local evidence: 478 landmarks, tracking state, high scale confidence, visible calibration GLB, and zero external runtime requests.
- Fixed browser packaging boundaries for shared compiled packages, `.mjs` MIME, and the complete Three.js module graph.

## Active implementation objective

`JSC-0002_SINGLE_FRAME_RUNTIME`

Deliver a single-frame vertical slice for J1-M:

```text
camera
→ face tracking
→ pose adapter
→ scale resolver
→ confidence gate
→ One Euro filtering
→ depth-only face mesh
→ 3D frame render
```

## Non-negotiable constraints

- Face video and landmarks stay in the browser by default.
- All runtime eyewear assets are 3D GLB; quality tiers are asset-quality tiers, not separate renderers.
- Product metadata uses millimetres; glTF runtime geometry uses metres.
- Low-confidence tracking must fail closed rather than display a visibly detached frame.
- `tenantId` and replaceable catalog origin exist from the beginning; billing and full SaaS controls do not.
- No prescription-lens or medical-measurement claims in the initial product.

## Immediate next tickets

1. `JSC-0205` J1-M measurements, source photos, normalized GLB, attachment matrix, and QualityEnvelope
2. `JSC-0206` actual-wear ground-truth annotations and first placement report
3. iPhone Safari and Android Chrome live-camera evidence

## External dependency note

MediaPipe and Three.js are pinned, self-hosted, and exercised by the browser self-test. The live camera path is integrated, but the automated in-app browser could not complete its page-external camera permission prompt. Physical J1-M inputs and iPhone Safari / Android Chrome device evidence remain external G1 requirements.
